| `?`             | Show all key bindings (search with `/`!)                      |
| `s`             | Sync all feeds                                                |

<details><summary>FAQ</summary>
# FAQ

### Which providers are supported?

See [news_flash_gtk for all supported providers](https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news_flash_gtk). 

### Does eilmeldung support smart folders?

Yes! Use queries in your feed list configuration. Example:

```toml
feed_list = [
  'query: "Important Today" #important unread today',
  'query: "Read Later" #readlater unread',
  "feeds",
]
```

### Can I customize keybindings and colors?

Absolutely! Everything is customizable via the [configuration file](docs/configuration.md). See `examples/default-config.toml` for all options.

### How do I save articles for later?

Create a tag (`:tagadd readlater red`), bind it to a key, and create a query in your feed list. See the [FAQ](docs/faq.md#how-can-i-save-articles-for-reading-later) for details.

### Can I hide feeds/categories/tags without unread/marked articles?

Yes, focus the feed list and press `2` / `3` to show only feeds/categories/tags with unread / marked articles, show all with `1`. Change the value of the configuration option `feed_list_scope` to either `all`, `unread` or `marked` to set the default value.

### When I mark an article as read, it disappears!?

By default, the article list shows only unread items. When you mark the article as read, it is automatically hidden. You can show `all` articles by focusing the article list and pressing `1`. If you want this to be the default, set `article_scope = "all"`. The same setting exists for the feed list (see previous item).

### Can I execute automatic operations after synchronisation/refresh?

Yes, via the option `after_sync_commands` [configuration](docs/configuration.md#after-sync_commands) for some recipes.

### Can I select articles and then mark them as read/unread/tag them etc.?

Yes, you can *flag* them by pressing `f` and then press `r` to mark all flagged articles as read. Similarly for `u`(unread), `m` (mark), `t` (tag), etc. Press `D` to remove all flags.

Checkout [FAQ](docs/faq.md#features--capabilities)!

### Is mouse input supported?

Yes, there is rudimentary mouse support with the option `mouse_support = true` (default is `false`). See [Mouse Support](docs/keybindings.md#mouse-support)]

## Mentions

- [Orhun's Blog: 800 rust projects in 3 years](https://blog.orhun.dev/800-rust-projects/) (placed 21 based on a Mastodon analysis; very hondered to be on the same list as other such great and impressive rust projects!)
- Pick on [Linux Unplugged Episode 647 (2025-12-28)](https://linuxunplugged.com/647) (1:28:35) had some very kind things to say about *eilmeldung* shortly after the initial release:
> "[eilmeldung] is [...] beautiful. It's strange to say about a TUI [...] but it is actually very beautiful."

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

*eilmeldung* was inspired by other awesome programs and libraries:

- [news-flash](https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news_flash) library and [news-flash GTK](https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news_flash_gtk), a modern Gnome/GTK RSS reader, both implemented in rust
- [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) which has been my TUI RSS reader of choice for many years
- [spotify-player](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player), a TUI spotify music player written in rust. In particular, the theming system and how input is handled has been a great inspiration for *eilmeldung*
- [vifm](https://vifm.info/), [neomutt](https://neomutt.org/) with [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org/) inspired the filtering and article query systems
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [vim](https://www.vim.org/) for their philosophy on user input
- [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) and all its supporting libraries for creating the TUI

## On the use of LLMs in this Project

This project was built as an experiment in learning Rust through LLM use. LLMs were used as tutors (asking questions, not providing solutions) and for documentation, but every line of code was intentionally written to solve a problem I understood.

📖 Read more about the LLM development approach in [LLM Development](docs/llm-development.md).
