## Commands

**eilmeldung** provides a comprehensive command system that can be invoked in two ways:

- **Command line**: Press `:` to open the command line, then type your command and press Enter
- **Key bindings**: Commands are bound to key sequences (see the Keybindings section for defaults and customization)

Commands may accept parameters such as scopes, queries, names, URLs, and colors. On the command line, press TAB to see autocomplete suggestions for available values.

### Using Commands in Key Bindings

Commands can be used in two ways:

1. **Via command line** (press `:`): Type the command and press Enter
   - Example: `:hintfollow f` - opens hint 'f'
   - Press Tab for autocompletion and tips.

2. **Via key bindings**: Defined in `[input_config.mappings]` in your config file

When creating custom key bindings, understand the difference between:

- **Direct commands**: Execute immediately with all parameters specified
  ```toml
  "x" = ["hintfollow a"]  # Opens hint 'a' immediately
  "s" = ["sync"]          # Syncs immediately
  ```

- **Command-line commands**: Open the command line for interactive input (use `cmd` prefix). This also automatically opens the autocompletion menu.
  ```toml
  "x" = ["cmd hintfollow"]  # Opens command line pre-filled with "hintfollow "
  "f" = ["cmd filter"]      # Opens command line pre-filled with "filter "
  ```

**Common mistake:**
```toml
# This generates an error as hintfollow expects a hint parameter
"x" = ["hintfollow"]  

# Use this to open command line for interactive input
"x" = ["cmd hintfollow"]

# Or this if the parameter is known in advance
"x" = ["hintfollow a"]
```

**When to use `cmd`:**
- Commands expecting user input: `hintfollow`, `hintshare`, `tag`, `filter`, `sort`, `rename`
- When you want to see/edit the command before executing
- When you want Tab completion for parameters

**When NOT to use `cmd`:**
- Commands that work standalone: `sync`, `quit`, `zen`, `read`, `mark`, `open`
- Multi-command sequences: `["open", "read", "nextunread"]`

## Input-Related Commands

These commands belong to text input (e.g. command-line or search input) and must be assigned to single keys:

| Command   | Syntax    | Context                        | Description              |
| --------- | --------  | ---------                      | -------------            |
| `_submit` | `_submit` | Input                          | Submit the current input |
| `_abort`  | `_abort`  | Input                          | Abort the current input  |
| `_clear`  | `_clear`  | Input                          | Clear the current input  |
| `_search` | `_search` | Input, Article List, Feed List | Open find (search) input |

## Sorting Articles

Articles can be sorted by one or more criteria. Set sort orders directly via the `sort` command, e.g.

```
sort feed date
```

Sorts articles first by feed (ascending) and then by date (newest-first).

To reverse the sorting order, use `sortreverse`. To revert to the default sorting order, use `sortclear`.
The [Configuration](configuration.md) option `default_sort_order = "..."` defines the default sorting order.
An [Article Query](queries.md) can also contain a sort order which takes precedence over the default sorting order.
A sorting order defined by the command `sort` in turn takes precedence over the sorting order from the query. The priority is therefore (from highest to lowest):

- sort order from `sort` command
- sort order from `query`
- default sort order


### Sort Keys

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `date` | Sort by article publication date/age |
| `synced` | Sort by when article was synced/fetched |
| `title` | Sort by article title (case-insensitive) |
| `author` | Sort by article author (case-insensitive) |
| `feed` | Sort by feed name (case-insensitive) |

### Sort Direction

| Symbol | Direction | Behavior |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `<` or omitted | Ascending | A-Z for text, newest-first for dates |
| `>` | Descending | Z-A for text, oldest-first for dates |

**Note:** For date-based sorting (`date` and `synced`), the natural display order is newest-first. Therefore:
- `date` or `<date` shows newest articles first
- `>date` shows oldest articles first

### Multi-Level Sorting

Combine multiple sort keys (separated by spaces) to create multi-level sorting. Articles are sorted by the first key, then ties are broken by the second key, and so on.

### Sort Order Examples

```
date                              # Sort by date (newest first)
<date                             # Sort by date (newest first, explicit)
>date                             # Sort by date (oldest first)
feed                              # Sort by feed name (A-Z)
>feed                             # Sort by feed name (Z-A)
feed date                         # Sort by feed (A-Z), then date (newest first)
feed >date                        # Sort by feed (A-Z), then date (oldest first)
date title                        # Sort by date (newest first), then title (A-Z)
feed date author                  # Sort by feed (A-Z), date (newest), then author (A-Z)
```
